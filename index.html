            <h3>What is COVID-19?</h3>
            <h4>
              COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most
              people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can
              become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better
              within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID
              conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new,
              returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more
              than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that
              causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain
              underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill
              from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.

            <h3>
              Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect myself?
            </h3>
            <h4>
              Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your
              family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and
              water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose,
              coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or
              preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use
              an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

              What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?
            </h3>
            <h4>
              People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms â€“ from
              mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days
              after exposure to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other
              symptoms, you might have COVID-19.
